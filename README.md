# My first site
## https://tyyti.github.io/

This project was created with React and brought to GitHub with the advice from https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

NOTE: The contact form doesn't send any information upon clicking the submit button.

I'm planning to continue working on this project, and get it on a server providing domain.


## Note to self: Things to work with

- Check the error with updating the gh-pages branch - maybe need to remake it?
- The contact form
- Organise check CSS styling
- Disabling the navigation menu icon from interactions upon entering the modal view
- CRUD
